    After a short period of time, the (mobile) browser will claim the pointermove event for "native" behavior like panning the page.

    The designed, simple solution is to use the css property touch-action and set it to none on the container that has the event handler.
   */
  touch-action: none;
}

.renderer_svg {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
